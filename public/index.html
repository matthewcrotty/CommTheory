        <p>In this Video clip, we see two famous scenes from Terminator, 
                and 2001: A Space Odessey. These two clips show two common fears
                people have around automation and robots.

        <h1>Common Fears about Automation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Robots aren't safe or trustworthy</li>
            <li>Automation will take all of our jobs</li>
            <li>Robots will be come Sentient and start the apocalypse</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h1>The Goal of this Website</h3>
        <p>This website was made to show that robots are beneficial to society
            and that these common fears have no basis other than media craze. Robotics
            and Automation are going to become more prevalent in society as technologies
            and methods are developed. Knowing how Automation works and why robots are here
            to help is important knowledge for everyone.

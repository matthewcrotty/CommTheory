        <h1>Robotic Precision</h1>
        <p>Automated machines have more precision and control than a human. 
         Robots can be programmed and designed to perform a task over and over without fatigue or error. </p>

        <p>Evidence: High Precision Formation Control of Mobile Robots Using Virtual Structures 
            Using a set of 3 different drive robots achieve high precision movements (Lewis and Tan, 1997).Virtual Structural is a multi-automation system in which 
            “each robot can execute the same control algorithm asynchronously and maintain the global formation (Lewis and Tan, 1997)”.

            <p>The same algorithm is used so there is no room for error The same algorithm is used so there is no room for error between each run of the algorithm as it is already programmed to work exactly 
                the same each time. This would be much more precise compared to a human performing the same task multiple times. Not every time would be performed exactly the same way because humans experience human error.

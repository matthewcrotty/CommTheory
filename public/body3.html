        <h1>Robot Apocalypse: Science Fiction and Not Fact</h1>
        <p>There is a stigma that robots are going to lose control one day and overpower humans. However, the current developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are not advanced enough and the general nature of AI is intended for other purposes. In addition, robots undergo numerous safety tests before they are fully manufactured. </p>
        <h2>Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (non-apocalyptic)</h2>
        <p>AI is already all around us ranging in form from ad targeting and product recommendation to self checkouts and siri. The one thing that a majority of these have in common is that they are limited to the digital realm (softbots instead of robots). Why? The real world is too largely unpredictable to be coded for given the current knowledge. Just being able to navigate the human world would prove challenging, which is why most robots are concentrated in their own space.</p>

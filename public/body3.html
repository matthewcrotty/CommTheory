        <h1>Robot Apocalypse: Science Fiction</h1>
        <p>There is a stigma that robots are going to lose control one day and overpower humans.
           However, the current developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are not advanced enough 
           and the general nature of AI is intended for other purposes. In addition, robots undergo 
           numerous safety tests before they are fully manufactured. </p>
        <h2>Can Robots Think?</h2>
        <h3>The Turing Test</h3>
        <p>A test developed by British computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950 that analyses a computer’s 
        ability to emulate humans. The test involves a human judge, a human participant, and a computer.
        The human judge must determine which of the two is the human. This test is originally designed to
        determine if machines can think.</p>

        <h3>Passing the Test</h3>
        <p>A few programs in the 1970’s named ELIZA and PARRY were able to fool psychiatrists with 50% accuracy -
           equal to random guessing. These programs were text-only interfaces between patients and judges. Since 
           then a Competition has been held every year to award prizes to the program that can pass the Turing test the best.
           Programs in AI research have been using more machine learning techniques as the technology has developed.</p>
        <h3>Conclusions from the Test</h3>
        <p>The programs are able to imitate humans - winning the imitation game - at least in text form, 
           but what these machines don’t do is think. They use calculations, natural language processing, 
           and data analysis to form sentences like a human, but these are nowhere close to thinking and intelligence.</p>
        <h3>The Nature of AI</h3>
        <p>All machines are created by humans to perform a certain task. 
           If a programmer wants their program to have needs, it has to be deliberately 
           and artificially implemented. On its own a robot doesn’t care. There is no way for a robot to
           go rogue unless it is told to do so.</p>

        <h2>Safety Procedures</h2>
        <h3>Saftey Testing</h3>
        <p>There are many safety testing procedures done before a robot is complete. 
           There are not only tests on the robot but there is also training for those who maintain and manage the robot.
           Robots get tested for both hardware and software malfunctions to prove that they are safe.</p>
